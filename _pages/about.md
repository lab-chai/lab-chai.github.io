<h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
Our mission is to make data-driven personalised healthcare a reality by uniting clinicians, industry partners, and health providers. Through this collaboration, we develop and apply pioneering causal AI methods to solve real-world health challenges and translate research into direct social impact.


<h2>🔍 Our Research Focus</h2>
We focus on the intersection of causality, healthcare, and AI, drawing on a blend of theory and practice to solve real-world problems and make an impact in personalised healthcare in the long run. We consider any topic which aligns with our research focus, including but not limited to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Individualised Treatment Effect Estimation</li>
  <li>Causal Inference</li>
  <li>Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Causal Foundation Models</li>
  <li>Applications in Healthcare</li>
</ul>


<h2>📢 Join Us</h2>
We are looking for curious, motivated researchers and students to join us in building the future of causal AI for healthcare.
