<h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
Our mission is to make data-driven personalised healthcare a reality by uniting clinicians, industry partners, and health providers. Through this collaboration, we develop and apply pioneering causal AI methods to solve real-world health challenges and translate research into direct social impact.


<h2>🔍 Our Research Focus</h2>
We focus on the intersection of causality, healthcare, and AI, drawing on a blend of theory and practice to solve real-world problems and make an impact in personalised healthcare in the long run. We consider any topic which aligns with our research focus, including but not limited to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Individualised Treatment Effect Estimation</li>
  <li>Causal Inference</li>
  <li>Deep Learning</li>
  <li>Causal Foundation Models</li>
  <li>Applications in Healthcare</li>
</ul>


<h2>📚 Recent Highlights</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I am co-editing a special issue (research topic) on <i>Causal AI</i> for the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Frontiers in AI</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/big-data" target="_blank">Frontiers in Big Data</a> journals: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/73155/causal-ai-integrating-causality-and-machine-learning-for-robust-intelligent-systems" target="_blank">Causal AI: Integrating Causality and Machine Learning for Robust Intelligent Systems.</a> <i>Manuscript Summary Submission Deadline 15 November 2025 | Manuscript Submission Deadline 27 February 2026</i></li>
