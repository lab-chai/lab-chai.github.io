  <h3>Dr. Vinod Kumar Chauhan</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Lecturer in Causal AI</b><br>
    <br> 
      I am a Strathclyde Chancellor's Fellow in AI (Lecturer/Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Strathclyde. I also hold a Visiting Scholar position and the MPLS Enterprise and Innovation Fellowship (2025–26) at the University of Oxford, UK. My primary research interests are in Causality, Healthcare, and Artificial Intelligence, with a long-term vision of realising personalised treatments through data-driven Causal AI. </br>
    
      Before joining Strathclyde, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, and the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, where I worked for over six years. During this time, I had the opportunity to collaborate with world-renowned clinicians and industry leaders, including Boeing and Rolls-Royce. At Cambridge, I was honoured to receive the Institute for Manufacturing Postdoctoral Award for Research Excellence in recognition of the practical impact of my work. I completed my PhD in optimisation for large-scale machine learning at Panjab University, Chandigarh, supported by the University Grants Commission’s JRF and SRF fellowships. </br>
    
      I actively contribute to the research community and have reviewed over 200 articles for more than 50 international conferences and journals. I currently serve as an Associate Editor for PLOS Digital Health and as an Editorial Board Member for the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare. </br>
      
      I welcome enquiries from motivated MSc (Research) and PhD students interested in causal AI, machine learning, and healthcare applications. I am also open to collaborations with academic, clinical, and industry partners who are committed to developing impactful solutions for real-world healthcare challenges.  </br>
